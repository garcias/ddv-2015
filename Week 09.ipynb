    "The data set hosted on Dryad is not **normalized**. The same variable appears in multiple columns, many rows refer to different observations (plants), and some categorical values (like population/year) have different labels in different parts of the table. This structure creates a few potential problems for analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Updating is error-prone.** There are many opportunities for a single mistake to damage the data set's integrity. For example, suppose a newly trained researcher wanted to add a new observation, for a particular variety, population, and year. They need to interpret these values — and then interpret the data set structure — in order to find the correct data block in the correct sheet.  \n",
    "- **Adding information changes the structure too broadly.** For example, adding just one new variable requires you to insert multiple columns in multiple worksheets. And if the researchers wanted to add data in subsequent years, they would need to add blocks of data to the right of existing blocks.\n",
    "- **Potential queries are limited.** The current structure is biased in favor of a specific type of query. Specifically, it favors looking first at variety, then year, and then population. But what if you wanted to see all plants that had more than three bracts per inflorescence, and see if particular varieties or years are overrepresented?\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems make the data structure difficult to interpret or update reliably. Importing the data into software will almost certainly fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to fix these problems by normalizing the data. A properly normalized data set (also called a “tidy” data set) organizes data in a consistent, efficient manner, with minimal redundancy. In a tidy data set, each variable is represented by a single column, and values for that variable appear only in that column."

The researchers did this to  keep data in these columns associated with each other. But this labeling pattern could be misinterpreted. For example, a reader might think that the variable “Seeds per plant” is defined differently between populations and years. (Perhaps there is a special correction factor applied between populations.) (The variables are actually defined the same way for all populations, because the researchers wanted to compare populations.)\n",

To correct this problem we: (a) cut and paste the data for each population into the same five columns, and (b) rename the variables to remove the reference to population and year.\n",

Note that the third Bihai population is not labeled using the same pattern — the researchers called it “B09” instead of “Boeri Lake 2009”, which is potentially confusing to the reader. We fix this manually by copying and pasting “Boeri Lake 2008” from A2 into K2, changing the year, and then copying and pasting down the rest of this column.

Fundamentally this is all we need, but we can still tidy up the *metadata* that describes the variables. For examples, we can imagine that some of the column headers will generate problems for typical software that may interpret symbols (like ‘&’, ‘/‘, and ‘()’) in idiosyncratic (and therefore unexpected) ways. We therefore rename the column headers to make them simple while remaining descriptive. Python’s dictionary syntax can deal with spaces in the names, but other software might be less forgiving, so we replace spaces with Python-friendly underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to write descriptions of each variable. When we read the metadata (to figure out if we could stack the columns) we notice a lot of redundancy in defining each variable. By structuring the data the way they did, the researchers had, in essence, generated combinations of two variables: a measurement (e.g. corolla length) and a population. When we stacked the data as we did, we eliminated these redundancies and defined each measurement variable without reference to the population, thus keeping the variables independent.\n",
