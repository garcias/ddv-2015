Course materials from Chem 391: Data-driven visualization for alumni to refer back to

## Whom is this for?

This page is dedicated to the alums of **Chem 391: Data-driven visualization**. 
In this special-topics laboratory course we explored and combined several aspects of programming, data structures, data conditioning, visualization, and general problem solving. 
Most of you had little experience with computing, but picked up computational thinking fairly quickly and produced some interesting projects.

## Why post it here?

Several of you have written back to say that this course was helpful in your career after graduating, often in unanticipated ways.
Learning to program, specifically for managing data, has come up in working for tech companies, government organizations, non-profit corporations, and graduate programs. 

And tacked on, ever so sweetly at the end of your letter, is usually a request to review the tutorials and exercises we worked on. 

No problem! Since they're mostly Jupyter (formerly IPython) notebooks, I've put them here on Github. It automatically renders them as html, so you can peruse the contents of each notebook just by coming to this page. But if you want to run the code, you can just download the `.ipynb` file and open it up with Jupyter. Depending on what's on your computer already, you might need to install `pandas`, `bokeh`, or `requests`.

## What has happened since?

The Chemistry Department definitely wants to offer some version of this course again, but current staffing demands and constraints will make this a challenge. In the meantime, I'm trying to work some insights from this course into portions of our more "standard" curriculum, including introductory courses.
